## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Medical image interpretation is central to the detection and diagnosis of cancer.
Understanding the basic science behind medical image interpretation through perceptual and cognitive research can improve clinicians’ accuracy, performance, and well-being.
At a time when medical imaging is being transformed by digital technologies and AI, medical image perception research is more important than ever.
Unfortunately, medical image perception remains chronically understudied.
In September of 2019, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) brought radiologists and pathologists together with researchers working in medical image perception and adjacent fields of cognition and perception for the "Cognition and Medical Image Perception Think Tank".
The Think Tank’s key objectives were: to identify critical unsolved problems in pathology and radiology, from the perspective of clinicians; to discuss how these clinically-informed questions can be addressed through cognitive and perception research; identify barriers and solutions for successful transdisciplinary collaborations; to define ways to elevate the profile of cognition and perception research within the medical image community; to determine the greatest needs to advance medical image perception; and to outline future goals and strategies to evaluate research’s progress.
This paper reports the deliberations of the Think Tank participants to address these objectives and highlight opportunities to expand research on medical image perception.
