In an era of unprecedented technological advances across the field of
medical imaging, it is critically important to understand the cognitive
and perceptual functioning of the "human in the loop," the clinicians
who make the final decisions on detection, diagnosis, and treatment. However, research on the cognitive and perceptual processes underlying clinician performance is chronically understudied.
In September 2019, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened the "Cognition and Medical Image Perception Think Tank" in order to advance research on medical image perception[^1] and cognition.
The Think Tank brought radiologists and pathologists together with researchers working in medical image perception and adjacent fields of cognition and perception, along with representatives from interested federal government agencies (including NCI, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security) to address the Think Tank's key objectives (see Table 1) through panel discussions, constructive discourse, idea generation, and problem-solving.
Panel discussions were guided by critical questions generated by the participants themselves in advance of the meeting.
Here, we report on the Think Tank's deliberations and highlight opportunities
to expand the research in medical image perception and cognition.
