## Summary of think tank deliberations
NCI's "Cognition and Medical Image Perception Thank Tank" brought together clinicians, perception researchers, and representatives from government agencies and the medical image community to deliberate and identify courses of action to advance medical image perception research.
Attendees pinpointed key challenges facing clinicians that could be addressed by appropriately designed perception research.
Barriers that have hindered successful trans-disciplinary collaborations between clinicians and perception researchers were discussed and potential solutions were purposed.
The meeting participants identified initiatives in education, collaboration, and research that could  elevate the field's profile within the medical image community, ways to promote perception education, collaboration, and research were identified.
Finally, concrete goals and strategies were established to evaluate the progress of medical image perception research as measured by expansion and advancement of the field and, ultimately as assessed by improvements in clinical practice and clinical outcomes.
Advancing medical image perception research requires active participation from clinicians, perception researchers, and the medical image community.
Together these fields can improve patient care by addressing the many and diverse challenges facing clinicians.
