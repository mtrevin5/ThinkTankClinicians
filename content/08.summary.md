## Summary of think tank deliberations
NCI's "Cognition and Medical Image Perception Thank Tank" brought together clinicians, perception researchers, and representatives from government agencies and the medical image community to deliberate and identify courses of action to advance medical image perception research.
Attendees pinpointed key challenges facing clinicians that perception research could address using an updated reverse translational model.
Barriers that have hindered successful trans-disciplinary collaborations between clinicians and perception researchers were discussed and potential solutions were purposed.
To elevate the field's profile within the medical image community, ways to promote perception education, collaboration, and research were identified.
Finally, concrete goals and strategies were established to evaluate the progress of medical image perception research in terms of improving clinical practice and clinical outcomes; and in terms of expanding and advancing the field.
Advancing medical image perception research requires active participation from clinicians, perception researchers, and the medical image community.
Together these fields can improve patient care by addressing the many and diverse challenges facing clinicians.
